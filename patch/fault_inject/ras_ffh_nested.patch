+	 * This patch is used in RAS FFH case.
+	 * In RAS FFH case lower EL EAs are routed to EL3 but to do reflection
+	 * of SError tests we need SError to be pended in tftf when SMC call is
+	 * made. Taking an SError depends on PSTATE.A bit of EL but if SCR_EL3.EA
+	 * is set, the SError is immediately taken. So to allow SError to be
+	 * pended in tftf we need to clear SCR_EL3.EA along with PSTATE.A masked
+	 * (which is done in tftf as part of test).
+	 * Since tftf cannot modify SCR_EL3 register, this hack is used in
+	 * SMCCC_VERSION path which tftf calls before running actual test.
+	 *
+	 * We can't directly modify SCR_EL3 and preserve it in context switch that
+	 * is why the context value is modified. The value of SCR_EL3 is modified
+	 * again while exiting EL3 in reflection path.
